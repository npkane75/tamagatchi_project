# tamagatchi_project I called mine skulltree.
The story of the game is that there is a this skull tree with all these other beings coming out of its brain its needs to be fed, able to sleep and needs to not get bored for it to thrive.  

USER STORY
The main objective in this game is to keep the skull tree alive by making sure that it is fed and that does not die of starvation.  You want to make sure that it has enough sleep to remain healthy and active and you want to make sure that the skulltree isnâ€™t getting bored and thus dying of boredom.  You have three buttons all of which help keep the skulltree alive. 
1.you want to start the game by clicking on the area where start is written.
2.It will then prompt you for your name. Type your name and the game will begin
3.you will see the health counter going up. You will also see the feed me counter, the sleep counter and the play counter all going up at the same time.
4. you need to make sure that none of those counters hit 10! Make sure you are pressing the button so that you can prevent the feed me, the sleep, and the play counters from reaching 10.
5. Once any of those counters reaches 10, the game is over and you loose.
6. if you wish to play again, press the clear game button and that will reset the game and press start again to restart the game.

The technologies used are, javascript, CSS, HTML. Vectorcoverters, image resizers, procreate

Some things I wish I could have solved was grid so that I could have a more interesting layout.  Flexbox was also something that I would liked to have gained more of grasp on.Also I would like to improve on the logic parts of javascript. to come up with some more clever ideas to add to the game.
I would have loved to add music, animation,hover effects and really make it come alive and more interactive as well as put more variables in the game.
